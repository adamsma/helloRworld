```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(helloRworld)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```
## The Tried and True

If you want to use the old stand-by "Hello, world!", just type `hello()`:

```{r hello, echo = FALSE}
hello()
```

## Making It Personal

If you want a bit more personal greeting and a present of data try this:

```{r presents}
Presents()
```

## Making It Really Personal

Suppose your login name isn't personal enough for you. You can set the name via `options(helloRworld.user = "YourNameHere")`

```{r reallyPersonal, echo=FALSE}

options(helloRworld.user = "Rterios")
Presents()
```
